# About Me 👨🏻‍💻

Freelance Full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience helping companies turn ideas into solid digital products. I like to think beyond the code, I care about the whole picture, from UX to architecture to business impact.

Strong in frontend (React, Angular, TypeScript, React Router, Next.js) and experienced in backend (Node.js, Python, FastAPI), DevOps, automated testing, and embedded development. With a background in design, engineering, and business, I take ownership, figure things out, and get things done.
